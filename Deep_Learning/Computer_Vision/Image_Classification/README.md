📌 Project Title

Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

📘 Project Description

This project implements an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The goal is to classify images of cats and dogs into their correct categories by learning visual patterns such as edges, textures, and shapes.

The notebook walks through all essential steps of building a deep learning model for computer vision, including:

Dataset loading and preprocessing

Building a CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras

Training and validation

Performance evaluation (accuracy, loss curves, predictions)

Visualizing model results

This project serves as a beginner–friendly introduction to computer vision and deep learning, showing how neural networks can understand images.
