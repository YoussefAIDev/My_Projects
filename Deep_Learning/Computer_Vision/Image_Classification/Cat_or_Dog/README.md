# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Project Description
This project builds an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs.  
The notebook walks through the full pipeline of creating a deep learning model for computer vision.

The workflow includes:
- Loading and preprocessing the dataset
- Building a CNN architecture with TensorFlow/Keras
- Training and validation
- Evaluating model performance (accuracy and loss)
- Making predictions and visualizing results

This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to image classification using deep learning.
