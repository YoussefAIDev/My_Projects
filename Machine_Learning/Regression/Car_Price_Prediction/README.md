Car Selling Price Prediction 🚗

Predict the selling price of used cars using machine learning regression models.
This project demonstrates a complete ML workflow from data exploration → preprocessing → modeling → evaluation → visualization, making it perfect for a portfolio showcase.

- Dataset 📂
 
The dataset used is car data.csv and contains the following features:

# Feature	Description

Car_Name	Name of the car
Year	Year of manufacturing
Selling_Price	Target variable – selling price in lakhs (INR)
Present_Price	Original price of the car in lakhs
Kms_Driven	Distance driven in kilometers
Owner	Number of previous owners
Fuel_Type	Petrol, Diesel, or CNG
Seller_Type	Dealer or Individual
Transmission	Manual or Automatic

# Project Workflow 🛠

# 1. Data Exploration (EDA)

Checked for missing values and data types.
Analyzed categorical feature distributions.
Identified correlations and potential feature importance.

# 2. Data Preprocessing

Dropped irrelevant columns such as Car_Name.
Encoded categorical features (Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission) using OneHotEncoder.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (90% train, 10% test).
Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler for better model performance.

# 3. Modeling and Visualization

Built Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models.
Evaluated models using R² score.
Compared model predictions visually using scatterplots and residual plots.

# Results 📊
Model Performance
Model	R² Score
Linear Regression	0.83
Lasso Regression	0.90

R² values may vary slightly depending on train/test split and scaling.


# Explainable AI - Feature Importance (Lasso)
Feature	Coefficient	Impact on Selling Price:

Present_Price	3.66	Higher original price → higher selling price
Year	1.01	Newer cars → higher price
Fuel_Type_Diesel	0.55	Diesel cars slightly increase price
Seller_Type_Individual	-0.40	Selling from an individual → lower price
Kms_Driven	-0.09	More kilometers → slightly lower price
Transmission_Manual	-0.13	Manual transmission → slightly lower price
Owner	0	Not significant in this model
Fuel_Type_Petrol	0	Not significant (baseline category)

# Visualizations 📈

Predicted vs Actual Prices: Scatterplots for Linear and Lasso Regression with a perfect prediction line.
Residuals Comparison: Residuals (Actual − Predicted) for both models to inspect errors and model fit visually.
Visualization helps to quickly identify model accuracy and potential overfitting.

# Requirements

Python 3.x with the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

# Steps to Run:

Clone the repository
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
Ensure car data.csv is in the correct path.
